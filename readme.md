# AWS Certification Cloud Practitioner

AWS Certification Cloud Practitioner is a very macro level overview of AWS services.

It is for sure the esiest exame because it doesn't go deep into subjects, but it actualy is challenging if you are aming to nail it and not just go for the 70% to get the badge.

Because of that I've compiled a list of the services that are covered.
Some of this descriptions where sourced from AWS Glossary, but some have a personal touch, so take them with a graint of salt, and do your own research.

For sure in only 65 questions not every service will show up, but AWS say in the Exame Guide that all this services and features are covered, so probably it's a good idea of having a minimal understanding of each one of them.
